# XYZtoHeightmap
Tool to convert XYZ Files to a 16bit Greyscale Heightmap
Takes in a XYZ File and outputs a GreyScale Heightmap with white being the highest and black the lowest point.
Has currently only been tested with a very limited amount of files. Currently only works with XYZ Files with a 0.5 data interval. Should be fixed sometime in the future.
Made to work with XYZ Files from https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/geodata/height/alti3d.html
